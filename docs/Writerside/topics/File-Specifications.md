The naming convention is [page slug]-[block].md

## CSV Files
The CSV workflow transforms the source set of CSV files (see list below) and generates a target set for publishing on the web using a set of python transformation scripts
1. Source Files: [project root]/app/data/source-files
2. Transformation Target Files: [project root]/app/data/output (For storing the output from transformations scripts)

## Conventions and Logistics
1. Most directories have an explanatory README file that provides detailed information about the respective folder. Please consult these files for additional information.
2. Source files are populated by copying the files from the respective GitHub repo directly into the data/source-files folder. Once copied into StaDocGen, the original files
are preserved in their original state without being subject to any programmatic alteration. The only time a source file is altered is when a new version is copied from the
source repository. In this instance the existing file is overwritten by the more recent version.
