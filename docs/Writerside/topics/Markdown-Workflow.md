# Instance Notes
Purpose: Provide specifications, usage remarks and technical documentation at the instance (standards) level. 
Please consult the corresponding topic for information regarding a specific instance of StaDocGen.

Important Note!
StaDocGen may be forked to a new repository then customized for a particular standard outside but adjacent to TDWG, such as 
the OpenDS model. Here, a project subfolder is not created for the standard. Rather, the forked version serves as the 
instance location and should be consulted accordingly. For project documentation purposes, child topics have been created
for these standards that include a clear annotation at the top of the page under Instance Type.
