MIDS-0 is a bare level of information that exists to make an association between a physical specimen with its identifier (eg, barcode) and an entry in a catalogue or database as well as the institution in which the specimen is held. One early action in a digitisation process is the creation of a database record that acknowledges or coincides with the existence or accession of a physical specimen into a collection, but not necessarily with any other information digitised at that stage.
