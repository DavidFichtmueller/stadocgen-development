The need to rapidly digitise millions of specimens in Natural History Collections has necessitated a 
staged approach for data capture. [The Minimum Information about a Digital Specimen (MIDS) specification](https://github.com/tdwg/mids) 
has been designed to provide a means of measuring and monitoring the level of digitisation of specimens within 
a collection. It also provides guidance for prioritising the data to be captured as well as recommendations 
for data standards and mapping structures.
