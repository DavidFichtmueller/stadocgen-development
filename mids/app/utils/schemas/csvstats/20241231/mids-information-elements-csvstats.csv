	                       To allow the curator/researcher to identify the physical specimen to which the data refer. To allow citation of the specimen. To enable the attachment of additional information to the specimen record. (1x)

	                       It is strongly recommended to use a globally unique persistent identifier, preferably resolvable, e.g. CETAF Stable Identifiers or DOIs. It is strongly recommended to map these to the DwC term materialSampleID. (1x)

	                       It is recommended to use the ontology being developed for the DwC term MaterialEntity. (1x)
