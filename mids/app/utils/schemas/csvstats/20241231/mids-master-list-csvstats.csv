	                       Usually established prior to any formal digitisation and hence considered a pre-level. MIDS-0 is a bare level of information that exists to make an association between a physical specimen with its identifier (eg, barcode) and an entry in a catalogue or database as well as the institution in which the specimen is held. One early action in a digitisation process is the creation of a database record that acknowledges or coincides with the existence or accession of a physical specimen into a collection, but not necessarily with any other information digitised at that stage. Note, however, that image(s) can be generated and referenced at this early stage. (1x)
	                       In addition to the creation of a basic digital record with an identifier (MIDS-0) enabling all other information (including images and/or other media types) to be associated with a single physical specimen, MIDS-1 includes the information often captured in the first stages of mass digitisation, defining the scope of the physical specimen and providing some information about the kind of object as well as a name attached to the specimen. Provides information about when the record was last updated as well as how the user is permitted to use the information. (1x)
	                       Regular records include the latitude/longitude data which are critical for many research applications including machine-readable formats. For botanical specimens the inclusion of collector name, number and date are a priority, given their historical use in acting as the identifier for the specimen in literature. These terms are routinely used to identify the specimen in requests to curation staff. For geological and palaeontological specimens the inclusion of geological age is a priority. (1x)
